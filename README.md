# runtime_digital_fingerprint

A Dart package for fingerprinting machines.


## Overview

This Dart package provides a solution for the problem of fingerprinting devices. Different pieces of information can be
used to identify devices. Some of these are MAC address, serial numbers assigned to hardware, and IP address. None of
these single pieces of information provides a guarantee of uniqueness, but if used together, then you may have higher
confidence of uniqueness.


## Uses

Keeping track of individual devices is important in areas such as software licensing and fraud prevention.


## Supported platforms

The `runtime_digital_fingerprint` package supports:
* macOS
* Windows
* Linux

The `runtime_digital_fingerprint` package is NOT currently available for:
* Android
* iOS
* web


## Installation

To add `runtime_digital_fingerprint` to your Dart package, include it in your pubspec.yaml file:
```yaml
dependencies:
  runtime_digital_fingerprint: ^1.0.0
```


## Usage

Import the `runtime_digital_fingerprint` package in your code and call the method that you want.

The list of currently available fingerprinting methods is:
* MachineID: a UUID that is generated at system install time

```dart
import 'package:runtime_digital_fingerprint/runtime_digital_fingerprint.dart';

const String machineId = await MachineId.machineId();
```


## Examples

```shell
% dart example/machineid_example.dart
The machineId for this machine is: 827AA042-5900-5208-9D1A-308FAF23E12A
```


## Tests

Run `dart test` or use the GitHub Actions workflow to run on multiple platforms.


## Implementation details for MachineID

### Main Features (copied from [here](https://github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid?tab=readme-ov-file#main-features))

* Cross-Platform (tested on Win7+, Debian 8+, Ubuntu 14.04+, OS X 10.6+, FreeBSD 11+)
* No admin privileges required
* Hardware independent (no usage of MAC, BIOS or CPU â€” those are too unreliable, especially in a VM environment)
* IDs are unique to the installed OS (not specific to user)

### Background

Adapted from [machineid Go package](https://github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid?tab=readme-ov-file#snippets)

#### Unique Key Reliability (copied from [here](https://github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid?tab=readme-ov-file#unique-key-reliability))

Do note, that machine-id and MachineGuid can be changed by root/admin, although that may not come without cost (broken
system services and more). Most IDs won't be regenerated by the OS, when you clone/image/restore a particular OS
installation. This is a well known issue with cloned Windows installs (not using the official sysprep tools).

Linux users can generate a new id with dbus-uuidgen and put the id into `/var/lib/dbus/machine-id` and
`/etc/machine-id`. Windows users can use the sysprep toolchain to create images, which produce valid images ready for
distribution. Such images produce a new unique machine ID on each deployment.

#### Security Considerations (copied from [here](https://github.com/denisbrodbeck/machineid?tab=readme-ov-file#security-considerations))

A machine ID uniquely identifies the host. Therefore, it should be considered "confidential", and must not be exposed
in untrusted environments. If you need a stable unique identifier for your app, do not use the machine ID directly.

> A reliable solution is to hash the machine ID in a cryptographically secure way, using a fixed, application-specific
> key.

That way the ID will be properly unique, and derived in a constant way from the machine ID but there will be no way to
retrieve the original machine ID from the application-specific one.
